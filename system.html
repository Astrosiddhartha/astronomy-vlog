                Introducing out intersteller neighbour <strong>The Alpha Centauri Star system</strong>.

                    This Star system is made up of three stars.<br />
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Alpha Centauri A</li>
                    <li>Alpha Centauri B</li>
                    <li>Proxima Centauri</li>

            <p>
                In this Star system Proxima A and B revolves around their common center of mass with revolution period of 80 years. The average distance between them being 23 astronomical unit. Proxima Centauri on the other hand revolves around these two stars from a
                distance of 13,000 astronomical unit.It's orbital period around the other two is 500,000 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Alpha Centauri A</strong> is the largest among them. It is a main sequence yellow star with a mass of 1.1 solar masses.<br />
                <strong>Alpha Centauri B</strong>, which is slightly smaller, has a mass of 0.97 solar masses thus, is an orange colored main sequence star.<br />
                <em>Proxima Centauri</em> being the smallest among them is a red dward star with a mass of 0.12 solar masses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, the talking about the distance from us. Both Alpha Centauri A and B are at almost the same distance from us which is 4.3 light-years. But, the other member of this Star system Proxima Centauri happens to be at a ditance of 4.22 light-years which
                makes it the closest star from our solar system.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have been restricted by our present technology at precisely detecting the presence of planets in the vicinity of Alpha Centauri system if not habitable planets. The same reason the existance of planet in Alpha Centauri is so exciting is also the reason
                it is difficult to detect any potential planets, its relatively close vicinity to our solar system along with its the brightness of the binary star.<br /> The third member of this Star system is rather promising at hosting
                planets. Red dward star Proxima Centauri star is evident to host a planet named Proxima Centauri B.
            </p>
            <p>
                Proxima Centauri B is a terresterial planet. It has a mass of about 1.3 times the mass of the earth. This planet orbits its host star from a distance of 7.5 million kms. or 0.05ly with an orbital period of barely 11.2 earth days. Although, this planet
                seem to be very close to its host star, it does lie in its habitable zone. Being located so close to a red dwarf poses other problems though.
            </p>
            <p>
                Proxima Centauri being a relatively young red dwarf its radiation output in x-ray part of the spectrum is very high as evident by these images taken from chandra space telescope. These high levals of x-ray radiation output is usually seen in young red
                dwarf stars like Proxima Centauri. These x-rays radiation bombard its planet Proxima Centauri B making it more hostile for life to exist.<br /> It is observed that Proxima Centauri B recieves an average of 500 times the
                x-ray bombardment that our earth recieves which peaks upto 50,000 times during a normal magnitude solar flare.
            </p>
            <p>
                These x-ray showers evaporate tons of matter from Proxima Centauri B. Due to these x-ray blasts there is a possibility that Proxima Centauri B doesn't have an atmosphere to sustain life. Also, since this planet is so close to its host star there is a
                chance of Proxima Centauri B to be tidally locked to its host star.<br /> Due to lack of a better technology, we can't confirm these speculations. All of which is said to change with the new <strong>James Webb Telescope</strong>.
                Researchers are hoping to use this telescope to determine if Proxima Centauri B has an atmosphere, James Webb Telescope because Proxima Centauri B is very faint in compaired to its host star.<br /> Expected to be launched on march 30,
                2021 this telescope has a mirror diameter of 6.5m, which is almost three times the mirror diameter of the Hubble Space Telescope. This makes James Webb Telescope the most powerful telescope till date. Using it we can peer into the farthest
                of galaxies. So we better hope this telescope could get to its orbit and we can use it to know more about out stellar neighbour.
